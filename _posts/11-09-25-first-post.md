I am a first year Mathematics PhD at the National University of Singapore.

I am broadly interested in Arithmetic Geometry, the Langlands Program and $p$-adic Geometry.

Before coming to Singapore, I was an undergraduate (2019-2023) and Masters (2023-24) at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India.
